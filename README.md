Hi Dr. Burns.

Welcome to CRAZY LABYRINTH as created by Austin Noska, Nathan Midgett, and Jake Eckert.

The game consists of 4 levels in ascending difficulty. The camera is zoomed in so that navigating the
labyrinth is part of the difficulty. Level 1 has little challenge and no obstacle holes to fall into.
Level 2 is harder to navigate and is designed for you to get lost. Level 3 is easy to navigate but
it introduces obstacles holes for the player to avoid. Falilure is now a possibility, though all it 
does is restart the level. Level 4 has significantly more holes and must be navigated with caution.

- The ball is controlled with arrow keys or WASD keys.
- The "High Score" counter in the top right corner denotes how many levels you have played through in a row.
- The "Restart Game" button will send you back to level 1.
- A counter starts at the beginning of each level. If you finish a level in a new record-time, a
  pop up will notify you. Otherwise, no popup appears.
- Finishing level 4 will begin you again at level 1.

Everyone helped with everything, particularly the scripting, but here are our key-contributions:
Austin: helped setup a github repository, programmed the UI, cleaned up our code and made it more professional
Nathan: Built all of the levels
Jake: Artistic stuff like texturing, making pretty hole prefabs
